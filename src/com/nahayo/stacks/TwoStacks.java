/**
 * Question:
 * Implement two stacks in one array. Support these operations:
 * push1() // to push in the first
 * stackpush2() // to push in the second stack
 * pop1()
 * pop2()
 * isEmpty1()
 * isEmpty2()
 * isFull1()
 * isFull2()
 *
 * Make sure your implementation is space efficient.
 * (hint: do not allocate the same amount of space by dividing the array in half.)
 *
 * Below is a Class that tries to solve the above
